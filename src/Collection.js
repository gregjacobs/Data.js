	/**
	 * @class data.Collection
	 * @extends data.DataComponent
	 * 
	 * Manages an ordered set of {@link data.Model Models}. This class itself is not meant to be used directly, 
	 * but rather extended and configured for the different collections in your application.
	 * 
	 * Ex:
	 *     
	 *     myApp.Todos = Collection.extend( {
	 *         model: myApp.Todo
	 *     } );
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Note: Configuration options should be placed on the prototype of a Collection subclass.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ### Model Events
	 * 
	 * Collections automatically relay all of their {@link data.Model Models'} events as if the Collection
	 * fired it. The collection instance provides itself in the handler though. For example, Models' 
	 * {@link data.Model#event-change change} events:
	 *     
	 *     var Model = Model.extend( {
	 *         attributes: [ 'name' ]
	 *     } );
	 *     var Collection = Collection.extend( {
	 *         model : Model
	 *     } );
	 * 
	 *     var model1 = new Model( { name: "Greg" } ),
	 *         model2 = new Model( { name: "Josh" } );
	 *     var collection = new Collection( [ model1, model2 ] );
	 *     collection.on( 'change', function( collection, model, attributeName, newValue, oldValue ) {
	 *         console.log( "A model changed its '" + attributeName + "' attribute from '" + oldValue + "' to '" + newValue + "'" );
	 *     } );
	 * 
	 *     model1.set( 'name', "Gregory" );
	 *       // "A model changed its 'name' attribute from 'Greg' to 'Gregory'"
	 */
