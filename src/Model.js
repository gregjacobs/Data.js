		 * 
		 * Anonymous config objects defined here will become instantiated {@link data.attribute.Attribute} objects. An item in the array may also simply

		 * configuration options.
		 * 
		 * Attributes defined on the prototype of a Model, and its superclasses, are combined to become a single set of attributes come
		 * instantiation time. This means that the data.Model base class can define the 'id' attribute, and then subclasses
		 * can define their own attributes to append to it. So if a subclass defined the attributes `[ 'name', 'phone' ]`, then the
		 * final concatenated array of attributes for the subclass would be `[ 'id', 'name', 'phone' ]`. This works for however many
		 * levels of subclasses there are.
		 * 
		 * Example:
		 * 
		 *     attributes : [
		 *         'id',    // name-only; no other configs for this attribute (not recommended! should declare the {@link data.attribute.Attribute#type type})

		 *         { name: 'lastName',  type: 'string' },

		 *             get  : function( value ) {  // // in this example, the Attribute has no value of its own, so we ignore the arg
		 *                 return this.get( 'firstName' ) + ' ' + this.get( 'lastName' );  // `this` refers to the model that owns the Attribute
