</span>	 * @abstract
	 * @class data.persistence.operation.Operation
	 * 
	 * Represents an operation for a {@link data.persistence.proxy.Proxy} to carry out. This class basically represents 
	 * any CRUD operation to be performed, passes along any options needed for that operation, and accepts any data/state
	 * as a result of that operation. 
	 * 
	 * Operation's subclasses are split into two distinct implementations:
	 * 
	 * - {@link data.persistence.operation.Read}: Represents an Operation to read (load) data from persistence storage.
	 * - {@link data.persistence.operation.Write}: Represents an Operation to write (store) data to persistence storage.
	 *   This includes destroying (deleting) models as well.
	 * 
	 * This class is used internally by the framework when making requests to {@link data.persistence.proxy.Proxy Proxies},
	 * but is provided to client callbacks for when {@link data.Model Model}/{@link data.Collection Collection} operations 
	 * complete, so information can be obtained about the operation that took place.

		 * {@link data.persistence.proxy.Ajax Ajax} proxy appends them as URL parameters for the request.
