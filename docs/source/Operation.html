<span id='data-persistence-operation-Operation'>	/**
</span>	 * @abstract
	 * @class data.persistence.operation.Operation
	 * 
	 * Represents a high level persistence-related operation executed on a {@link data.Model Model} or 
	 * {@link data.Collection Collection} (i.e. a {@link data.DataComponent DataComponent}. This includes load, save, 
	 * or destroy (delete) operations. 
	 * 
	 * An Operation is made up of two parts:
	 * 
	 * 1. One or more Proxy {@link data.persistence.request.Request Requests}, which are used to fulfill the operation, and
	 * 2. The state that represents if the Operation has been completed in regards to the {@link #dataComponent} (Model or 
	 *    Collection). It is possible that all of the requests have completed, but the {@link #dataComponent} that the Operation 
	 *    is operating on has not been updated with the result of these requests just yet. The Operation is not considered to be 
	 *    {@link #isComplete complete} until this second part has finished.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ## Sequence of Operations with Collaborators
	 * 
	 * In the following sequence diagram, the Collection's {@link data.Collection#method-load load} method is called. Collection delegates
	 * to a created instance of the Operation class, which then delegates to one or more {@link data.persistence.request.Request Requests}
	 * (such as if multiple pages of data are being loaded at once), and finally to a {@link data.persistence.proxy.Proxy} to perform 
	 * the actual Requests. 
	 * 
	 * When all Requests are complete, and the Collection has added the new {@link data.Model Models}, then the Operation is resolved,
	 * causing {@link data.persistence.operation.Promise#done done} handlers on the Operation's {@link #promise} object to be called.

	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ## Deferred Interface
	 * 
	 * The Operation implements the jQuery-style Deferred interface, and is controlled by the DataComponent (Model or Collection)
	 * which instantiates it. The interface, while not the full jQuery Deferred implementation, includes:
	 * 
	 * 1. The ability to attach {@link #done}, {@link #fail}, {@link #cancel}, {@link #then}, and {@link #always} handlers, 
	 *    to detect when the Operation has completed successfully, has failed, or has been canceled, and
	 * 2. {@link #resolve}, {@link #reject}, and {@link #abort} methods for setting the completion state of the Operation. 
	 *    These are called by the DataComponent (Model or Collection) which instantiated the Operation, with the exception
	 *    of {@link #abort} which may be called by client code of the {@link #dataComponent} to cancel an Operation.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ## The OperationPromise
	 * 
	 * This object's {@link #promise} object (an {@link data.persistence.operation.Promise OperationPromise}) 
	 * is returned to clients when they call the load/save/destroy methods on {@link data.Model Models} and 
	 * {@link data.Collection Collections}, so that they can respond to the Operation's completion. 
	 * 
	 * This Object supports the same interface as standard jQuery promises, but adds the extra method 
	 * {@link data.persistence.operation.Promise#abort abort}, which can cancel the Operation, and the {@link #cancel}
	 * method which is used to subscribe handlers for if the Operation is canceled.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ## Subclasses
	 * 
	 * Operation's subclasses represent the three varieties of high level operations:
	 * 
	 * - {@link data.persistence.operation.Load}: Represents a Load operation from persistence storage. A Load operation
	 *   uses {@link data.persistence.request.Read Read} request(s) to fulfill its requirements.
	 *   
	 * - {@link data.persistence.operation.Save}: Represents a save operation persistence storage. This may use
	 *   to {@link data.persistence.request.Create Create} and/or {@link data.persistence.request.Update Update} requests
	 *   to fulfill its requirements.
	 *   
	 * - {@link data.persistence.request.Destroy}: Represents a destroy operation on the persistence storage. A Destroy
	 *   operation uses {@link data.persistence.request.Destroy Destroy} request(s) to fulfill its requirements.
	 * 
	 * This class is used internally by the framework for making requests to {@link data.persistence.proxy.Proxy Proxies},
	 * but is provided to client callbacks for when {@link data.Model Model}/{@link data.Collection Collection} persistence
	 * operations complete, so information can be obtained about the request(s) that took place.
